curses libraries may seek terminfo database in weird places
I have ncurses.so.3.4 looking for /usr/share/terminfo
and ncurses.so.3.0 looking in /etc/terminfo or /usr/lib/terminfo

The environmental variable LD_PRELOAD can be set to
force a specific library to be loaded after the other to 
override functions. It might come handy when experiencing
troubles with libncuses.so.4 (LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libncuses.so.3)

Running `sins' itself will not get you in the game,
you need to issue commands to create the players.
Commands are issued with the `:' (eval) key while running
or with the 'source <file>' command on command line.
The file ~/.sinsrc is sourced automatically.
(run *-sins -L for a list of available commands)
