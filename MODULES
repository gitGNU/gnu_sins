MODULES IMPLEMENTATION (0.15)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$Id: MODULES,v 1.2 2005/06/10 12:24:20 strk Exp $

A snake module can implement one or more snakes players.

The modules.c source file contains a function called ``init_modules''
which in turn will call init functions of all modules. You' ll have to
add your init function call there.

The module's init function returns int and takes no arguments.

This function must create one or more snakes with the snake_make() function

	snake *mysnake1, *mysnake2;

	mysnake1 = snake_make ();
	mysnake2 = snake_make ();

If needed you can keep snakes personal data in a structure and assign
the structure pointer to the ``brain'' element of the snake structure,
which is a void *.

	/* this is an example structure, you can make your own */
	typedef struct t_brain {
		DIRECTION preferred_dir;
	} brain;

	brain *mybrain1, *mybrain2; 

	mybrain1 = (brain *) malloc (sizeof(brain));
	mybrain2 = (brain *) malloc (sizeof(brain));

        mybrain1->preferred_dir = UP;
        mybrain2->preferred_dir = DOWN;

	mysnake1->brain = mybrain1;
	mysnake2->brain = mybrain2;

Now you have to define the callback function, that will be called at
player's turn with one argument: the player's pointer.

	DIRECTION myplay ( snake *mysnake )
	{
		brain *mybrain;

		/* you MUST cast this */
		mybrain = (brain *) mysnake->brain;

		/* this is how you set the new direction */
		return mybrain->preferred_dir;
	}


This function's reference must be assigned to the ``play'' element
of your snakes:

	mysnake1->play = &myplay;
	mysnake2->play = &myplay;

Finally you can register the new players:

	int player1, player2;
	
	player1 = register_player (mysnake1);
	player2 = register_player (mysnake2);

Then compile your source with the -c flag and make an object file (mod_your.o).

Add this object to the MODULES line in the Makefile and make. Good luck!

MORE ON CALLBACK FUNCTION
-------------------------

snake structure
===============

The callback function can modify everything of a snake:

	/* snake structure from modules.h */
	typedef struct t_snake {
		int playernum;			/* player number */
		char name[MAXNAMLEN];		/* snake's name */
		int look;			/* snake's look */
		snakebody *head;		/* snake's head chain */
		snakebody *tail;		/* snake's tail chain */
		int length;			/* snake's length */
		int grow;			/* snake's growing state */
		int died;			/* did this snake die? */
		int dir;			/* snake's movement direction */
		unsigned long int score;	/* score */
		DIRECTION (*play)();		/* decision taker */
		void *brain;			/* snake's brain */
	} snake;

You SHOULD only touch the ``brain'' element and contents.

The ``grow'' flag is used by the movement engine to make the snake
grow: when greater then 0 the snake is grown by 1 and the flag is decremented.

The ``died'' flag must be 0 in order to be alive.
Set it to 1 for a suicide. 

The ``score'' element is not worth touching, unless you really feel
cool doing it ... 

The ``head'' and ``tail'' are the first and the last rings of the body chain
you could have fun with it, but I never tried, check it out!

The ``look'' element is obsolete.
It gave the visual rappresentation of the snake, but that's UI-dependent.
Shouldn't play with it, it is assigned by ``register_player()''.

scanning the arena
==================

The arena (play field) is a *sprite* bidimensional array.
To scan the whole arena you should do something like:

	int y, x;
	sprite *sp;

	/* ARENA_HEIGHT and ARENA_WIDTH are macros defined in modules.h */
	for ( y=0; y<ARENA_HEIGHT; y++ )
		for ( x=0; x<ARENA_WIDTH; x++ )
			sp = ARENAGET(y,x);

Then you can check the content of the arena sprite with the
macros defined in snake.h:

	IS_FRUIT(sp)
	IS_SNAKE(sp)
	IS_EXSNAKE(sp)
	IS_WALL(sp)	/* for later use */

sp is NULL if the sprite is empty

	
moving cells
============

Since the screen is a round surface (exit right enter left, exit down enter up)
you might want to have an external function move arena-inspecting cells for
you. You do have it !

	extern void move_cell ( cell *from, DIRECTION dir, int steps );

By the way, the cell structure:

	 /* board cell */
	 typedef struct t_cell
	 {
		int x;
		int y;
	 } cell;

Since I didn't say it yet, here is the snakebody:

	/* snake body (a sprite) */
	typedef struct t_snakebody
	{
		int type;
		struct t_snake *self;
		struct t_cell cell;
		struct t_snakebody *next;
		struct t_snakebody *prev;
	} snakebody;

What about:

	void myplay (snake *)
	{
		move_cell(s->head, s->dir, 1);
	}

... Don't try it at home !
   	

fruit
=====

The fruit is exported as a struct t_fruit:

	extern fruit frt;

	/* fruit structure */
	typedef struct t_fruit {
		int type;
		struct t_cell cell;
		int value;
	} fruit;


keyboard
========

The input queue may be scanned with the function fetchtypein().
This function will return all queued characters.
Will return -1 on empty queue.

	while ( (ch=fetchtypein()) != -1 )
	{
		...
	}

Don't bother about other players, the same queue will be available
for all of them.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Since version 0.7 command handlers may be registered by modules.

Commands may be given in the configuration file, as arguments when
starting the game, during the game in command mode (enter with ``:''),
or througt a fifo if compiled with the --enable-cmdfifo argument.

The command handler function will be given as argument the string given
AFTER the command itself and is triggered whenever a user command starts
with its label (rather confusing, sorry).

Prototype: int CMD_handler(char *);

Must return 1 on success, -1 on error (no way of returning what kind of
error occurred, syntax error is assumed and the help string is returned)

To register the command use the register_command function with three
arguments: the command label, a pointer to the handler function and an
help string.

Prototype: int register_command (char *, int (*)(char *), char *help);

The command label must be shorter then MAXCMDLBLLEN. The command line
composed of the command label PLUS the command arguments can't be
longer then MAXCMDLINELEN. The help string should be short enough to
fit on a line of the game display area (variable actually.. duh!).
