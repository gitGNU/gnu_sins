Set SVGALIB_DEFAULT_MODE to the video mode you wish to use.
The value can be either in the symbolic form (es. G800x600x256)
or in the numeric form (es. 1)

Sprite dimensions can be specified with the command
'spritesize <width> <height>'. It will work only before
screen initialization (in config file or on command line).

Border size is set with `bordersize <size>'. The size is the
number of sprites the border will take.
