BUILDING AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR snake
================================================

1. Short way

  $ cd src
  $ ./configure
  $ if test `whoami` = "hacker"; then vi config.h Makefile; fi
  $ make 
  $ make install

2. Configure options

  --disable-timeout

    Disable the pleyer timeout feature. This feature does not let AI
    players think too much when deciding which direction to take.
    It might not work on all systems (uses setjmp longjmp).

  --disable-cmdfifo

    This feature lets you use the 'cmdfifo' command to specify the
    name of a file to read commands from. Disable it on system that
    does not support FIFOs.

  --with-readline

    If you want to use GNU readline with the command line interface
    ( linked only against the curses versions )

  --help

    Shows the complete list of supported configure options. They
    are supported by `configure' but most of them are not considered
    by the code itself... they should though :(


3. Sins commands

  Commands may be specified in a file called ~/.sinsrc, on the command
  line, during the game hitting the ``:'' key (on supporting interfaces)
  or throug a fifo file (initialized with the command ``cmdfifo <path>''.

  A list of available commands can be obtained using the ``-L'' command
  line switch. There could be different commands for the different
  interfaces. 
  
  NOTE: the `sins' executable is just a shell wrapper, it won't accept
  any switches... you must run one of the interface-specific executables
  (sins will give you a list of the available ones).
