- FIX pointer math (segfaults as hell on 64bit systems)

- add a dist: rule in Makefile

- mod_wall.c:
	o create_wall check

- ui_X.c:
	o reduce network traffic when writing text !

- CORE:
	hooks
	allow for command execution wait request
		I mean, if a command needs the arena initializated
		but it is not yet, let it ask for a delay so it
		can try again to execute later (then arena is
		initialized)

- ui_X.c:
	o finish() on delete/destroy events
	o pause() on unmap/focusout? events
	o better font metrics (?)

- adjust delay value evaluating overall actual game speed ..
  ( augment it if the loop always takes longer ... )

- remove message expiration code from the core module and put it
  in each individual UI module when applicable...

- call module_defined killer and destroy functions ...

- Check bug in font usage (ui_vga2.c) [ segv on low resolution ? ]

- Find a new package for all the modules (one directory for each module?)
  Add documentation for specific UI modules

- Add a ui_refresh function in UI modules (probably triggered with ^L)

- implement a non-blocking getch() for minix

- provide an arena_copy function for use by AI modules

- remove MAXPLAYERS limit (really? when network layer is implemented, maybe!)
  this will make impratical snake reset by digit press (still working with
  the ``reset'' command though)

- add compile-time option to enable dynamic loadable modules (really?)
