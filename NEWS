HISTORY

0.23cvs

	- Fix build of X ui on systems where AC_CHECK_X
	  doesn't set x_libraries and x_includes

	- Added history support for curses UI.

	- Initial camera support.

	- Cleaned up for GNU coding standard acceptance.

0.22
	- Code development put under CVS.
	  See ChangeLog for news.

0.21
	- utils/makepictset improved [ ahahah ;) ]

	- ui_picts.h:
		default pictset copied from spheres_8x8 (I think this
		is the best apart from players' number recognition)

	- mod_wall.c:
		added a bare wall support module
		now usable but very very boring interface

	- arena.c:
		added range check in arenaput and arenaget

	- ui_X.c:
		o Bug fixed in ui_drawarena when configured to use
		  arenawin pixmap (USE_ARENAWIN_PIXMAP). Now is
		  pretty faster ..
		o more cleanup in ui_finish()
		o better handling of keyboard states (no more
		  private control of `shift' pressed, use of
		  xevent.state instead)

0.20
	- ui_X.c:
		o arenagc tile pixmap is set by send_pictset.
		  now init_background just fills the window or
		  the arenawin pixmap (no more clear to permit
		  working on the pixmap)...
		o define USE_AFTER_FUNCTION renamed to DEBUG_X_PROTOCOL
		o XSync called after arenawin mapping to discard all
		  pending events thus avoiding a big Expose at startup

0.19
	- arena.c:
		BUG_FIX: arena.board initialized with all zeroes.

	- ui_X.c:
		o default font definition changed to "*-misc-*".
		o modified send_pictset so to reduce ChangeGC protocol
		  requests to the server. Also incorporates draw_pict
		  ( used exclusively by send_pictset anyway ).
		o added define REDRAW_ARENA_ON_PICTSET_CHANGE
		  so you can reduce network traffic undefining it
		o added USE_AFTER_FUNCTION as a bare Xprotocol
		  traffic checker
		o create_arenawin(): pixmap used for the cursor
		  is freed after use
		o init_background: background initialization is done
		  by clearing the window after send_pictset set its
		  background pixmap.
		  

0.18
	- mod_ai.c:
		added a bare final check for walls (pretty dumb...)

	- snake_move.c:
		kill a snake when hits a wall

	- sins.h:
		added IS_WALL macro

	- main.c:
		added pause_game(), resume_game() public functions
		updated parse_input.c accordingly ...

	- ui_X.c:
		added a USE_ARENAWIN_PIXMAP define 

		fixed a bug in SPRITEINMESSAGEBOX, changed
		exposure events handling, maybe reducing network traffic

	- main.c:
	  delay.c:
	  sins.h:
	  parse_input.c:
		Delay is now of type `long' and is expressed in
		microseconds (no more milliseconds). Its value
		is checked agains the difference between timeval 
		got at each game_loop() and tells when it's time
		to play or when it's only time to refresh the 
		output ( ui_drawarena() calls ) and parse the input
		( parse_input() calls ).
		MAXDELAY have been updated to 2 seconds (2000000 msec)
		and DEFAULTDELAY/DELAYSTEP defines have been added
		in sins.h.
		parse_input() does not reset typein queue unless
		the turn is advanced ...

	- main.c:
		extracted a game_loop() function from the main().

	- delay.c:
		always print new value when changing delay

	- parse_input.c:
		ui_drawarena called while waiting for an answer to
		the "really quit?" question (with no delay here ...)

		restyled the 'q' and 'Q' cases handling ...

	- ui_X.c:
		removed all those fontminbearing things...
		reduced stored information in a single structure
		called `msgbox' which contains font origin and
		boundaries ...

		Used a region to keep exposure informations.

0.17
	- ui_X.c:
		Set a white border of 1 pixel for the arena window.
		It might be confusing in case of a white background ...
		Anyway, the WM will usually discard that border setting
		its own one instead ...

		Set Class Hints (#define USE_CLASS_HINTS)

	- Makefile.in:
		sins.h added as dependency for all build rules

	- sins.h:
		removed `STOP' direction
		removed IS_VDIR, IS_HDIR, IS_ORTOGONAL macros
		redefined IS_OPPOSITE macros removing `abs' call.
		removed `look' element from snake structure.

	- mod_ai.c:
		`play' prototype corrected
		other fixes on direction type usage.

	- snake.c:snake_init():
		bug fixed, died flag not set ...

	- ui_X.c:
		invisible cursor set for arenawindow

		font flickering reduced. message box is not always
		deleted before the other drawing ...
		removed strdup calls.

		commands loadfont and fontcolor will work even
		before screen initialization

		bug fix in default window dimension
		computation.

		Backing store on arenawin made optional
		( #define USE_BACKINGSTORE for this )

		Set size hints for arena window.
		This will forbit window resize if windows managers
		honour those hints... resizing is handled anyway
		for windows managers that do not.
		( #define USE_SIZE_HINTS for this )

0.16
	- delay.c:
		bug fix in CMD_delay. Now prints the current
		delay value when called without arg.

	- ui_X.c:
		implemented ui_prompt.
		better handling of fonts (yet to be finished).
		new commands `fontcolor <colordef>' and
		`loadfont <fontdef>' (only valid after screen
		initialization)

0.15
	- ui_X.c:
		started to test some font usage ...
		must define TEST_FONTS in order to check it ..

	- sins.h:

		typedef int DIRECTION
		.. changes where needed ..
		.. MODULES document updated ..

	- ui_curses.c:

		Bare color handling.
		Color use can be controlled with the `colors [ ON | OFF ]'
		command.
		By default colors will be used if the terminal knowns
		how to handle it.

		New drawing optimization mechanism, copied from
		ui_X and ui_vga ... an arena look map is kept
		instead of an arena pointers map.

	- mod_ai.c:
		used the new macro LOOPDIRECTION

		fixed a bug in the play function when 
		looking for the first safe direction to take
		( not so safe, but less buggy )

	- New macro in sins.h:
		LOOPDIRECTION(x):
			loops on all directions setting `x' to
			their integer values.

	- snake structure change: element `play' is a function
	  returning int (the direction itself). Modules are not
	  more required to touch the snake structure. Instead
	  their `play' functions will return the desired direction.
	  We still touch the `brain' element though...

	- New function: snake_init in snake.c. Called from main.c
	  after arena initialization so to have the real dimensions
	  of the arena before assigning initial directions.
	  You can now use `kill <#>' commands on command line and
	  initialization files.

	- Main loop no more interrupted on game pause. Instead
	  an extern variable game_paused is set by the parse_input 
	  routine when hitting the spacebar. The main loop does not
	  give play turns to the players if the game is paused but
	  continues to redraw arena.

	- DEFAULT_SEARCHPATH define moved to config.h
	  and overwritten in Makefile so to point to
	  $datadir/pictset and ~ (home)

	- SEARCHPATHLEN define moved to snake_limits.h

	- Makefile install rule will copy the share directory
	  to $datadir


0.14

	- ui_X.c:
		o redraw arena on resize events
		o pixmap use for pictset storage
		o handled shifts in ui_getkey() 
		o dumb call to XKeycodeToKeysym at arena initialization
		  to force client caching of mapping info
		o redraw arenawin rectangle on Exposure events
		o a set of 16 colors are looked up in the default
		  colormap (XAllocColor)

	- Added a sins shell wrapper that lets you choose your 
		among available interfaces

	- sins.h:
		snake structure has two addictional elements:
		a killer function and a destroyer function.
		These should called before any other destruction
		handling by the core module. 

	- command.c:CMD_fifo():
		an attempt is made to create the fifo

	- Added a bare ANSI interface

	- Fixed --with-readline handling (only links with curses version)
	  Corrected document INSTALL

	- First bare 'install' Makefile rule

	- Rewritten the arena drawing optimization routine. 
	  The old one made a wrong assumpion about sprite addresses.
	  Since snake body units are allocated and freed while the
	  game is running it was often happening that the same address
	  contained different pices of a snake thus making the optimization
	  routine think there was no need to update a cell of the screen
	  while indeed it was needed. (is it clear ??)
	  
	- Added a public `game_pause()' function in parse_input.c

0.13

	- Makefile update: you do not specify user interface anymore.
	  All interfaces are possibly built. To built a specific sins
	  version use for example: make dumb-sins.

	- Bare implementation of an X user interface
	  (check #define USE_ROOT_WINDOW in ui_X.c)

	- $HOME/.sinsrc is sourced at startup. No more config file
	  or SNAKE_CONF environment.

	- Added a -L (--list-commands) option to show all avaiable
	  commands.

	- Removed the -f <config> switch (use 'source <config>' instead)

	- Renamed all exported UI functions. Now they all start with
	  ``ui''. Removed updatescreen from the exported funx list.

	- Executable are named after the ui_module used in linking

	- Only a SPACEBAR will get you out of pause mode (SPACEBAR to enter)

	- Messages disappear now after a given time (more or less
	  indipendently from the current delay)

	- Implemented `draw_messages' and `prompt' interface funx in
	  ui_vga2.c

	- Removed all stupid messages like "Yum", "CaboOOm" and the like..

	- Bare font usage in ui_vga2.c (gl). Added -lvgagl in configure.in
	  when --with-ui=vga2

	- New format for the pictset file (ui_vga2). On the first line
	  we need to have a line like this: "#WxH". Where 'W' and 'H'
	  are integers. This will tell the pictset loader the Width and
	  Height of each sprite. The new loadpictset command does not
	  require a sprite size ( loadpictset [<fname>] ).

	- A new directory ``utils'' has been created in the package.
	  It now contains a makepictset script used to create a default
	  pictset for ui_vga2 module. It also contains a script to send
	  'loadpictset' commands to the engine via the fifo interface
	  looping on all available pictsets in a directory.

	- ui_vga2.c: you can't load a pictset with a different size from
	  the one in use.

0.12
	- Added some new pictset :)

	- fruit.c: command `mfprob <percent>' added so you can specify
	  magic fruit probability at runtime.

	- command.c: fixed a bug in CMD_cmdfifo that tried to fclose
	  an inizialized FILE pointer.

	- ui_vga2.c: command loadpictset with no arguments sets back the
	  default pictset

	- ui_vga2.c: bug fixed in pictset loading function

	- ui_vga2.c reads now the SVGALIB_DEFAULT_MODE for a prefferred
	  videomode
	
	- Name change from snake to sins (Sins Is Not Snake) due to
	  a name conflict with the BSD classic snake.

	- when a random free space on arena is needed we start from
	  a random point and scan the whole arena. If no space is
	  left we finish() the game (should we do differently?).
	  Cases are: snake_make, init_fruit, snake_reset.

	- added ui_vga.c support for -l and -c switches.
	  two ui_vga.c new commands: ``spritesize <width> <height>''
	  and ``border <num>''

	- snake_make will mark snakes dead and set coordinates to
	  0 when screen is not yet initialized. The main routine
	  will reset all snakes before entering the main loop.
	  This allows to parse all commands before screen initialization.

	- player timeout and fifo interface are now on by default.
	  use --disable-timeout and --disable-cmdfifo to disable them.

	- added a public cell_distance(cell *, cell *) to snake_common.c
	  (*could* be user by AI modules)

	- QUIT_ON_LAST_DEATH define moved from snake.h to snake_snake.c

	- made ui_vga change sprite dimensions based on -l and -c
	  switches (rather contortous)

	- implemented a *very* bare dumb interface (--with-ui=dumb)

	- (temporary?) removed modules.h -- too hard to mantain...

	- ARENA_HEIGHT and ARENA_WIDTH macros now directly access
	  the global ARENA structure (for speed reasons.. later
	  I should think about code separation)

	- changed public init_graphics prototype to take
	  ARENA * as argument.

	- optimized arena drawing function in ui_curses.c
	  and ui_vga.c -- only modified sprite in arena board
	  are drawed.  For big displays (eg. curses ui within
	  xterm 800x600 tiny font) you can see the difference.

0.11
	- implemented destroy command for snake
	  ``destroy <snakenum>''

	- changed ALL ``zoo'' loops. a NULL pointer
	  does NOT rapresent the end of the players set
	  anymore. Instead a NULL pointer is an EMPTY SLOT.
	  All the slots are now scanned (0 .. MAXPLAYERS).

	- implemented a bare vga user interface
	  run configure with the --with-ui=vga argument
	  to give it a try (always check Makefile after that)

	- user Interface modules name change to ui_<name>

	- AI snakes now check if the new position of their new head
	  could be reached in one step by other snakes.

	- added an implementation of usleep() using select()

	- bug fixed in mod_ai.c: dump_score format changed

	- CMD_ai may now be called without parameters (takes
	  default weights for missing parameters)

0.10

	- bug fixed in snake_curses.c (missed up with screen
	  on terminal error)

	- added a GETSPRITE macro to obtain the sprite
	  pointer given an ARENA pointer, an y and an x
	  coordinate. This sould be used instead of ARENAGET
	  by core modules (all but the player modules).
	  PUTSPRITE should go next.

	- draw_arena() takes now an ARENA pointer as
	  argument

	- struct arena_t typedef'd as ARENA

	- delay implemented with usleep() instead of
	  empty for loop on systems suppporting it

	- added a snake_core.a rule in the Makefile
	  contains all objects except GRAPHIC_MODULE
	  and mod_*

	- draw_motion() no more extern.
	  snake_curses.c is the only module aware of it
	  and will call draw_motion inside draw_arena(). 
	  (motion visualization is optional in the graphic module)

	- removed napms() call from snake_main.c
	  ( curses dependent )
	  sleep time now implemented as an empty for loop
	  
	- new getkey() function in snake_curses.c
	  called in snake_parse_input.c instead of
	  the curses-dependent getch()

	- removed snake_menu.c module

	- new order of initialization in snake_main.c:
	  parse_cmdline_opts()
	  init_{graphics,arena,fruit,modules}()
	  parse_{config,cmdline_args}()

	- finish_graphics() declared in snake_<gui>.c will take care
	  of endwin() instead of finish() declared in snake_main.c 

	- int i declared static in snake_main near setjmp
	  to avoid loosing counter value

0.9

	- removed function draw_fruit_position from snake_curses.c
	  [snake_fruit module will message() new position]

	- removed function draw_delay from snake_curses.c
	  [motion widget will show it]

	- arena is now declared in snake_arena.c as a struct arena_t
	  defined in snake.h.
	  The new options ``--lines (l)'' and ``--cols (c)''
	  set the ononimous elements of this structure.
	  The arenainit function (snake_arena.c) does not take any argument
	  now (it gets the lines and cols from the arena structure).
	  The init_graphics function sets the lines and cols element
	  to the maximum allowed size if set to 0.

	- configuration file is now specified with the -f option (not -c)

	- mod_ai.c: moved the scored direction structure in the snake
	  brain ( a first kind of memory ? ).

	- allocating/freeing memory for each and every snake movement
	  was probably not a good idea. i declared a snakebody pointer
	  in the snake_move.c module so to use the old tail as the
	  new head when not growing.

	- limits.h moved to snake_limits.h, created snake_compat.h.
	  improved portability.

	- removed eval_command (static in snake_command.c)

	- parse_command removes now leading spaces in command string.

	- New help command (not so friendly right now).

	- Added an help string in the command_table structure (snake_command.c).
	  Better structured command handler function interface:
	  must return -1 on syntax error.

	- Added ./configure option to enable TIMEOUT on AI modules


0.8

	- Autoconf-enabled !

	- Bug fixed in mod_human (make_brain did not clean space allocated
	  for the input key queue - now uses safe_calloc instead of safe_malloc)

	- Added safe_calloc in snake_common.c

	- Added a command line feature  (use ':' to get a prompt).
	  readline can be used for this (define WITH_READLINE in config.h)

	- Command handler functions (CMD_*) now check that 
	  the given argument (char *) is not NULL before playing
	  with it ...

	- New registered commands: 'kill', 'trim', 'reset', 'quit'.

	- New fifo interface for commands. Define COMMAND_FIFO
	  in config.h and then specify a fifo file at startup
	  or in the configuration file with the command 'cmdfifo'

	- command line parsing now allows for configuration-file
	  commands to be specified on command line.
	  '-d' option disappears and leave the place for the new
	  registered command 'delay #'
	  Try: snake -c /dev/null 'delay 10' 'human j i l k'

0.7.2

	- added a 'reason' argument to safe_malloc (quicker debug)
	  define DEBUG_MALLOC in snake_common.c to have malloc reasons
	  printed on stderr

	- HAVE_GETOPT_LONG and HAVE_GETOPT_H in config.h

	- updatescreen() does now call touchwin to avoid screen
	  scrabmling with some terminals.

0.7

	- rewritten the configuration algorytm. we now have a command
	  table holding handler pointers for command label.
	  register your commands with the register_command function !
	  [snake_config.c]

	- made snake_make, snake_kill, snake_trim, snake_reset be one
	  file called snake_snake.c (does it make sense?)

	- added safe_malloc and safe_realloc in snake_common.c
	  ( will die on error )

	- added a MAGIC_FRUIT_PROBABILITY define in snake_fruit.c.
	  define it with a value between 0 (no magic fruits) and
	  100 (only magic fruits)
	  
	- keyboard input must now be read by modules using the function
	  fetchtypein(). it may be called multiple time (will return -1
	  on empty queue). mod_human has now an input key queue in order
	  to remember typed keys (at most MAXQUEUELEN [defaults to 2])

	- bug fixes in snake_move (head-crashes sometime failed to kill)

	- yet another menu rewrite (no more menu!), just use SPACE
	  to pause the game and see the scores, 'q' to quit ('Q' to
	  avoid questions), a number to reset a dead snake, '-' or '+'
	  to decrease/increase speed.
	  
0.6

	- rewritten the menu facility, now uses the message function

	- rewritten the movement module so to handle head/tail
	  crashes (removed injustice bug, which coused snakes
	  to die because of lower or higher play precedence)
	  
0.5

	- `play' functions are now time-wrapped
	   so that too-complex brains won't slow down
	   the game (that would be unfair)
	   instead, brain coder should consider taking fast
	   decisions and then fine tuning them while thinking

	- added config.h with defines for play_limits and messages 

0.4

	- the arena is now a separate matrix, we now have a deeper
	  knowledge of our world (we, the snakes!)

	- added a user message facility (shall be a queue one day)
	  this is in snake_messages.c

	- added a module.h to be included by modules instead of snake.h


0.3

	- removed dynamic load of modules (portability issues)

	- recognize a few options ( see snake --help )
